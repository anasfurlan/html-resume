<p>Hello, my name is Ana Maria, I'm 29 years old, I'm Brazilian. I currently live in Spain and I believe I feel part of it here too. I'm passionate about the arts, I like doing crafts, painting and I spend most of my time reading books, I'm also passionate about the world of games so whenever I can I'm trying something new. I love traveling and seeing what the world has to offer, meeting people and new cultures and lifestyles that enchant me. I love recording moments and places where I go and, above all, I love living the simple, the ordinary. </p>
